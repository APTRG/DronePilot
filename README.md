# Drone Pilot

Automatic pilot software that can control and fly several drones, including Pixhawk's, APM's and MultiWii's

## Current scripts:

* mw-joystick-test.py -> Send joystick commands via UDP from a ground-station running Matlab to a FC running MultiWii software.
* mw-hover-controller.py -> Calculate commands to make a Multiwii multicopter hover over a specified x,y,z coordinate.
* pix-logdata.py -> Script that logs data from a computer vision thread and from a flying multicopter with a Pixhawk. DroneApi related.

## Caution

This code is still under heavy development, everyday I add and remove stuff. Proceed with caution.
